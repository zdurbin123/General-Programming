# General-Programming
This repository displays some of the scripts I have created, including algorithm implementation written in Java and C (see 'Algorithms' folder), development of Full Stack web applications using Node.js (see 'Full_Stack' folder), development of a Recipe API using Node.js (see 'Recipe_API' folder), and the implementation of three machine learning algorithms (polynomial fitting, decision tree and genetic mutation - see Machine_Learning folder). Refer to thr comments at the top of the code files or the README files within the project directories for further details.
