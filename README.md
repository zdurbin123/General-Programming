# General-Programming
This repository displays some of the scripts I have created, including algorithm implementation with Java and C (see 'Algorithms' folder), development of Full Stack web applications using javascript (see 'Website/Blessed' folder), development of a Recipe API using javascript (see 'Recipe API' folder), and the implementation of two machine learning algorithms (polynomial fitting and genetic mutation) leveraging the sci-kit-learn package in python.
